            <p>
                Dataminr, a leading real-time information discovery platform, recognized the need to enhance its digital asset management capabilities. 
                In response to this, a comprehensive research project was initiated to identify, evaluate, and procure a Digital Asset Management (DAM) 
                software solution that aligned with the company's unique business needs.
            </p>

                        <p><strong>Lizeth:</strong> This phase marked a significant shift in my approach to research. I quickly recognized the need to actively listen for underlying challenges that weren’t immediately apparent in initial conversations. By focusing on understanding stakeholders’ specific workflows and frustrations, I refined my ability to ask more nuanced questions. I also learned the importance of managing conflicting needs among stakeholders, which strengthened my coordination skills and set the stage for clear, informed decision-making as the project progressed.</p>

                        <p><strong>Lizeth:</strong>This phase challenged me to refine my research process. I developed a more systematic approach to evaluating vendors, relying on both objective data and qualitative insights from stakeholders. I found myself balancing technical specifications with the softer aspects of vendor relationships, such as communication style and responsiveness. Managing initial outreach was particularly instructive in establishing a clear, professional tone that fostered productive early-stage conversations, and I gained confidence in navigating vendor negotiations and building rapport.</p>
